## Responsive Web Design

### What is it?

Responsive web design is a web design technique that explores the correct display of the same page on different devices, from desktops to tablets and mobiles. Nowadays, we access websites from all sorts of devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones; this creates the need for our website to accommodate their different sizes.

### But what precisely is this?

It is about resizing and placing some elements of the web therefore they adapt to the width of each device, allowing a correct visualization and a better user experience. Responsive web design is distinguished because the layouts (content) and images are fluid, and it uses CSS3 media-queries code.

Responsive web design reduces development time, avoids duplicate content, and increases the virality of content as it allows sharing them in a much faster and more natural way.



Responsive web design bases on providing all users of a website with the same content and a user experience that is as similar as possible, over other approaches to mobile web development such as apps.

```bash
To create a responsive website, add the following <meta> tag to your HTML:
```
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
