## What is it?

Responsive web design is a web design technique that explores the correct display of the same page on different devices, from desktops to tablets and mobiles. Nowadays, we access websites from all sorts of devices such as computers, tablets, and smartphones; this creates the need for our website to accommodate their different sizes.

## But what precisely is this?

It is about resizing and placing some elements of the web therefore they adapt to the width of each device, allowing a correct visualization and a better user experience. Responsive web design is distinguished because **the layouts (content) and images are fluid**, and it uses CSS3 media-queries code.

Responsive web design **reduces development time**, **avoids duplicate content**, and **increases the virality of content** as it allows sharing them in a much faster and more natural way.



Responsive web design bases on providing all users of a website with the same content and a user experience that is as similar as possible, over other approaches to mobile web development such as apps.

```html
Start adding the following <meta> tag to your
HTML file to create responsive web design:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```
### 4 Main attributes for Responsive Web Design:
---
* The layouts and images are fluid and adapt to each screen.
* Reduces development time.
* Avoids duplicate content.
* Increases the virality of content.


Making a responsive website is trendy, but like all trends, most people do it without knowing exactly why.

Nowadays, we have many options to offer to the users who visit our websites from mobile devices; these are **Mobile Friendly sites**, **Native App**, and **Responsive Websites**. Each of these has its pros and cons. However, the one that is gaining the most strength is the responsive web due to a simple fact: it is the cheapest and fastest, but not for that reason is it the easiest to make, even if it looks like it.

This technique has completely changed how it is designed. It has changed the pattern. Not only this technique but the user himself and his browsing and consumption habits have changed the rules. Google recommends responsive design before creating a full mobile web page:

>"Google recommends Responsive Web Design because it's the easiest design pattern to implement and maintain." 

The reasons are clear, the user experience will improve considerably, we avoid potential duplicate content problems, and we give the user a consistent image. However, even if Google recommends it, your website may not have to have a responsive design. For example, if you have a landing page and you are focused on conversion, you may need a different design on mobile, and this technique, therefore, does not fit since you want to show other information.

## 3 Points to take into account when making responsive web design

* **Loading a Website**:
  * One of the biggest problems we find when we do an audit in responsive designs is the loading of elements do not differentiate at the server level. This is a big problem when loading the website since when making the responsive website, the same resources are loaded as for a desktop website. To solve this, we should try to use libraries that allow us to do a conditional page load, avoiding loading unnecessary resources when people visit from their mobile devices.

* **Screen Sizes**:

  * One has to be very careful when designing websites. It is recommended to design with the mobile-first pattern to avoid having adaptation problems with the screens. It is also necessary to avoid overloading the page with useless elements. The large number of devices and screens that exist at the moment in the market is immense. We have to take into account fluid and non-static content sizes to avoid users who do not see our content well, leading them to a bad user experience.

* **Avoid effects**:

  * Some of the effects we used on the desktop website will not work on the responsive web design. This is extremely vital, since if a multi-device-platform check is not done at the time of creating the website, we may find that surprisingly the time per visit from mobile is strangely low. This occurs a lot, for instance, when the "read more" of a news item appears in the hover. The hover does not exist on mobile, so the user will not be able to continue their visit.

When working with responsive web design, one cannot forget to continuously measure to detect possible leaks and performance failures in mobile browsing. Also, keep in mind all these things into account before launching a website. Responsive web design improves the user experience, as we have seen in this article, but it does not always have to be this way.

In conclusion, responsive web design consolidates as one of the best practices in web design today. Although like all of them, it has its pros and cons, the responsive web is considered today the best possible practice in web design
