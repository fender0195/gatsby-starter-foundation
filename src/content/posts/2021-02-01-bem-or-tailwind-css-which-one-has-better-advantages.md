description: The advantages of using BEM and Tailwind CSS
---
Tailwind and BEM are two different ways of writing CSS and differentiating them is a bit difficult as they are both very helpful when programming. But in this article, I have written the best advantages to know when to use BEM and Tailwind when it is most needed.

BEM:

The purpose of BEM is that you can create a more consistent code structure, not just duplicate styles, and bring clarity to the code by defining and establishing a better hierarchy in your project. BEM also consists of creating or naming classes of independent elements, making the style sheets simpler and easier to understand, divided into blocks, elements, and modifiers.

Advantages:

• Add specificity: Use a unique selector for each rule, allowing you to reduce it and do less repetition.

• Increases independence: Blocks can be moved anywhere in the document without affecting styles.

• Improves multiple inheritances: Any of the three games can be changed without affecting the others.

• Allows reuse: It is possible to recycle certain areas of code from one project to another, due to the non-existence of major dependencies regarding the implementation of each of the structured blocks.

• Delivers simplicity: Allows easy understanding once the logical process on which it is based is known. In turn, the conventions when naming classes allow you to have absolute control by knowing what, who and where we refer within a structure.


Tailwind CSS:

Tailwind is a CSS framework that allows much faster development, it is based on utility classes that can be easily applied in the same HTML code and allow to optimize the weight of the CSS code. Tailwind consists of modifying the HTML to insert classes that are necessary to apply a style to the components.

Advantages:

• Less use of CSS: The CSS file is smaller but in return, you are left with a better style that works well with the elements of the web design (layout, sizes).

• The maintenance and modification of the web are much easier: Any change is more simplistic. Since you avoid re-executing the creation of style sheets, changing CSS classes. It's as easy as adding or removing classes in the exact place.

• Design is faster: It is now easy to launch into new designs since building the interface is much faster. It is also faster to change the structure of the website and make design modifications and tests by changing a few classes or HTML markup.

• Better use of code: This is invaluable. Being able to create different components (sliders, blocks, navigation) ensuring that no CSS styles should be added or modified in projects.

• Perfect for responsive designs: With Tailwind CSS it is very intuitive to create flexible designs adapted to almost any device, especially the smallest screens. 

Both BEM and tailwind CSS have different advantages that can be very helpful when programming websites. I believe that in the end the use and knowledge of both are what makes a good developer. Knowing how to combine and use BEM and Tailwind CSS in our codes will help us create better codes and build better websites.
