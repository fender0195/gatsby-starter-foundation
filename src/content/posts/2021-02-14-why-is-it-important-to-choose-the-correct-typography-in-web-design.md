Typography is an essential aspect that web designers should not overlook. Letters are key elements and depending on how it is presented; their meaning can change, since each type of letter, shape or color represents a different style and language. For this reason, it is essential to make good use of the font size, color combination, alignment, and justification to be clear about what you want to transmit to users. 

The typography for each web design depends on the website's purpose, and its creator should choose it according to their taste. However, the designer must also take into account the requirements of the client. Some will think that the use of certain fonts is a mere whim of the designers. However, some typography is one of the most important aspects in any branch of the visual arts, and in the case of web design, one of the factors that most affect the way users process information.

Reasons to choose the correct typography for web design:

* The effects that can be applied to fonts in web design are limited. One solution is to create an image with the text; this can be useful for titles, menus, or labels but never for long texts, for various reasons: the page would take a long time to load, it would not be indexable by search engines, and the text could not be enlarged, making it difficult to read.
* Good typography makes the text legible. If the text is difficult to read, users will leave the page. Studies have shown that when we read a text written in a light typeface, we frowned less and achieved better cognitive performance. Also, when defining a size, we have to indicate the pixels. As a general rule, 11 or 12 is a readable size. Sizes smaller than 8 or 9 pixels should not be used.
* Like any other element of design, typography implies a way of communicating. So, developers can even imagine that each source has its voice. For this reason, we must choose the font that best represents the values of different brands.
* Good typography can define, by itself, the aesthetics of almost an entire website. There are many sites with designs based mostly on the combination of striking fonts, where the effort put into images or animations is minimal. This approach has two advantages: it makes the design process more bearable, and it avoids using elements that can slow site loading.
* Not all fonts look good on the Internet. It is important to verify that the typeface is friendly, so it does not look cut or fuzzy. Google Fonts is a very useful and well-known website that contains a collection of free fonts suitable for use in web design.

Remember that readability, contrast, and the use of 2 or 3 fonts at most are extremely important in web design. As we can see, the choice of a font can determine the success or failure of websites.
